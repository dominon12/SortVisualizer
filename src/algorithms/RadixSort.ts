      <p>
        Radix sort is an non-comparison based sorting algorithm. 
        It uses radix of the elements to distribute them in buckets 
        to avoid the comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
        It sorts the elements by first grouping or distributing them in 
        buckets on the individual digits of the same place value.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example suppose we have an array of 10 elements. 
        First, we will sort elements based on the value of the unit place. 
        Then, we will sort elements based on the value of the tenth place. 
        This process goes on until the last significant place.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it breaks the elements at itâ€™s place after every cycle, 
        radix sort can only be performed on integers.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should be familiar with the counting sort before 
        learning radix sort because it uses counting sort as an intermediate sort.
      </p>
      <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
            First find the largest element from the array i.e max and let d be 
            the number of digits in the max, because we have to cycle 
            through each significant places of the largest number.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, go through each significant place one by one and use any 
            stable sorting technique to sort the digits at each significant place. 
            I have used counting sort for this as it is an integer based sorting algorithm.
        </li>
